## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-Search engine optimization using the <meta> tag.
```html
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, Front-End Mentor">
<meta name="description" content="3-Column Preview Card solution">
<meta name="author" content="nadupoy">
```

-I had trouble making the layout of the cards responsive to different screen sizes and eventually figured it out with the CSS3 code below using Flexbox.
```css
html{
        background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
        margin: 0;
    }

body{
        width: 80%;
        margin: auto;
    }

div#content{
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        margin-top: 20%;
        margin-bottom: 20%;
    }
```


### Continued development

- I would like to learn more about responsive web design using the Flexbox workflow.
- Learning semantic HTML5 elements will also be an area of focus so as to enable me to optimize projects for the web. (I would like to move away from the indiscriminate use of the <div> element.)


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This helped me understand HTML tags, attributes and CSS properties. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
